Things to Do on Dayshaper
-------------------------

 - Add support for disabling a task for a given period of time.
 - Implement "Reflect" mode.
 - Add JQuery to static assets.
 - Add timer to "doing" page.
 - Fix chooser so it handles slower-than-daily tasks.
 - Refactor views so each view function has just one view.
 - Allow me to add a "note" to the task when I'm finishing it, to remind myself
   of something to do next time.
 - In the various summaries, show how often each task was done ("once",
   "twice", "3 times", etc), as well as the total amount of time spent on that
   task.

Completed:
----------

 + Add "minutes" to the min/max times on the "Doing" page.
 + Rename heading on "Doing" page.

Reflect mode should list the various tasks we've done, on a daily basis.
Ideally, it would show all the tasks over the past week, with the total amount
of time spent on each task over the week, and then a daily breakdown going from
most recent back in time.

How about the current week?  I'd like to be able to go from the start of the
week.
