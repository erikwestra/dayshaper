Things to Do on Dayshaper
-------------------------

 - Remove "Preferences" button and page.
 - Store Dayshaper source on my private Github account. 
 - If no task is selected when the user clicks on the "Add Task" button, add a
   new top-level task.
 - Disable the "Add Sub-Task" button if there is no task selected.
 - Only show the strategy field if a task has children.
 - Only show the weighting field if a task's parent has a strategy of
   "proportional".
 - Only show the min_time and max_time fields in a task doesn't have children.
 - Add support for disabling a task for a given period of time.  This requires
   me to have a "make_active_at" field for the task.
 - Add a "Pause" button to the "doing" page for when I'm interrupted.
 - Implement the "First Unfinished" task chooser.
 - Implement the "Random" task chooser.

Future Possibilities:
---------------------

 - Allow me to add a "note" to the task when I'm finishing it, to remind myself
   of something to do next time.
 - In the various summaries, show how often each task was done ("once",
   "twice", "3 times", etc), as well as the total amount of time spent on that
   task.
 - Add an option to the "suggest" page: "Sorry, I need to work on <X> instead",
   where "X" is a drop-down menu of all enabled and unfinished tasks.  Or
   similar -- maybe an option to temporarily disable an item?
 - Allow program to run for multiple users?

Completed:
----------

 + Add "minutes" to the min/max times on the "Doing" page.
 + Rename heading on "Doing" page.
 + Change "static" to "assets".
 + Add JQuery to static assets.
 + Add timer to "doing" page.
 + Can I have the "doing" page beep when the time is up?
 + Fix chooser so it handles slower-than-daily tasks.
 + Refactor views so each view function has just one view.
 + Change "reflect" mode to use last 7 days, rather than starting always on a
   Monday.
 + Add a sound that is played when a task is started, and when a task is
   cancelled.
 + In the "Suggest" page, show the most recent activity if it was finished in
   the last hour, along with options to "This task is finished" and "Don't work
   on this task again today."
 + Consider adding different "strategies" for choosing the next task.  The
   current scheme could be called the "proportional" scheme, as it tries to
   ensure you work on tasks according to their weighting.  Alternative
   strategies might be: round-robin (working strictly in order), "in order"
   (always choose the first unfinished task in the list), and maybe even
   "random".
 + Add support for marking a task as "finished".
 + Change "Plan" UI so that we show child tasks in the "Edit" view.
 + Option to rearrange items, moving items between lists.
 + Use a UI library to improve the user experience?
